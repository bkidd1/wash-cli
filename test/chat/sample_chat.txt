User: I'm having trouble with this Go code. It's not working as expected.
Assistant: Could you share the code you're working on?
User: Here's the code:
```go
func calculate(x int) int {
    return x * 2
}
```
Assistant: I see. What's the expected behavior?
User: I want it to handle negative numbers differently.
Assistant: You could modify it like this:
```go
func calculate(x int) int {
    if x < 0 {
        return x * -1
    }
    return x * 2
}
```
User: That works! Thanks for the help.
